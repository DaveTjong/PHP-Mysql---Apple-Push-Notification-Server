Apple Push Notification Server.
------------------------------

These script allow you to manage push notifications for one or more apps.

FEATURES:

* Multiple App management.
* Multiple Certificate Management (Developmnet/Production).
* Simple web form to submit push notifications.
* Single connection per certificate to the APNS servers.
* Message Queue.
* Apple Feedback processing to remove devices that should not subscribed any more. 
* Send push notifications only to test devices.

REQUIREMENTS:

* PHP 5.x
* mySQL 

PORTS:
It requires ports 2195 and 2196 to communicate with the APNS servers.


INSTALL:

* Create a new mySQL DB. Run the "resources/APNS.sql" file to create the DB tables. 
* Copy your ck.pem certificates to the certificates folder. 'ck' means the certificate and key components are on the same file.
* Add an app entry to the mySQL 'Apps' table.
* Add a certificate to the mySQL 'Cerficates' table.
* Add an entry to the 'CertificateServer' table.
* Customise the 'config.php' file.

BASIC USAGE:

1) Registering new devices:
	
	Your iPhone apps can register new devices by calling a URL in this form:
	http://YOURDOMAIN.COM/registerDevice.php?appId=YOURAPPId&deviceToken=YOURDEVICETOKEN

2) Submit messages to the queue:

	To submit a message to the subscribed devices use the following:
	http://YOURDOMAIN.COM/form.php

3) Send messages to the devices from the message queue:

	http://YOURDOMAIN.COM/processMessageQueue.php

4) Process feedback:

	http://YOURDOMAIN.COM/processFeedback.php


SCHEDULING:

Ideally the processMesageQueue.php script should run from a cron job or scheduled task.
After running processMesageQueue.php you should run processFeedback.php to get 
notified of devices that no longer have the appId installed.
