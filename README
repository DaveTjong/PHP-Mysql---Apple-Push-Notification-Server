Apple Push Notification Server.
------------------------------

These script allows to manage push notifications for one or more apps.

The service registers the device and associates it to an app. Once a device is
associated to an app you can send them push notifications via a web form.
If the user has un-installed the app, you can get notified by using the
Apple Feedback service script.

INSTALL:

* Create a new mySQL DB. Run the "resources/APNS.sql" file to create the DB tables. 
* Copy your ck.pem certificates to the certificates folder. 'ck' means the certificate and key are on the same file.
* Add an app entry to the mySQL 'Apps' table.
* Setup 'config.php'

USAGE:

Registering new devices:

Your iPhone apps can register new devices by calling a URL in this form:
http://YOURDOMAIN.COM/registerDevice.php?appId=YOURAPPId&deviceToken=YOURDEVICETOKEN

Adding messages to the queue:
To send a message use the following:
http://YOURDOMAIN.COM/form.php

Send pending messages from the message queue:
http://YOURDOMAIN.COM/processMessageQueue.php

Process feedback:
http://YOURDOMAIN.COM/processFeedback.php


SCHEDULING:

Ideally the processMesageQueue.php script should run from a cron or scheduled task.
After running processMesageQueue.php you should run processFeedback.php to get 
notified of devices that no longer have the appId installed.


SECURITY:

Please store this scripts in a secure folder so they are not access
by non authorized users.

I hope you enjoy these scripts!
